# Assignment 1.08 | Loading Monsters and Objects
- This assignment is for CS 327 Spring 2021
- We used Prof. Schaeffer's solution code for 1.07
- We did NOT implement stacking of items
- Bug: when first generating dungeon, items do not show, but once you go up or downstairs, the items will show
   - Loads at least 10+ items (usually loads 13 items per dungeon)
- Object class in assignment_108.h
- We put everything that had to deal with monster in npc/monster_desc

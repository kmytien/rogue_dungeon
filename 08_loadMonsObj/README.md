# Assignment 1.08 | Loading Monsters and Objects
- This assignment is for CS 327 Spring 2021
- We used Prof. Schaeffer's solution code for 1.07
- We did NOT implement stacking of items
- Bug? Sometimes it randomly freezes, but we think it might be our computers
- Object class in assignment_108.h
- We put everything that had to deal with monster in npc/monster_desc
- We also used Shaeffers Makefile for this so run the code with ./rlg327 and not ./run like we usually do

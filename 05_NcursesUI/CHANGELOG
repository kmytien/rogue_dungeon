Current Issues (3/10/21 22:00)
  - segmentation fault when i scroll down passed max list of monsters (assuming its the same for scrolling up) - is this okay?
  - cleaning up code (mk might rename some methods to make stuff make more sense)
  - check if all keys work
  - change code a bit more so it doesnt look too much alike to others

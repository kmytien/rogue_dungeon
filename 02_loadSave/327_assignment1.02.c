/**
 * CS 327: Assignment 1.02: Dungeon Load/Save
 * Project by: Sanjana Amatya, MyTien Kien, Haylee Lawrence
 */

 /** WHAT TO DO
    1. make a save function (saves game to disk before terminating)
    2. make a load function (loads dungeon from disk instead of making a new one)

    Weâ€™ll add two switches, --save and --load. The save switch will cause the game to save the dungeon to disk before
    terminating. The load switch will load the dungeon from disk, rather than generate a new one, then display
    it and exit.

/**
    -- we need to implement hardness this assignment: a room or corridor has hardness of 0, the outer most cells have hardness of 255,
       every other cell has random hardness between 1 - 254 --

    In Main:
        - set up directory
        - finish if statements for --save and --load parameters

    Save function:
        - write to a file (home/username/.rlg327/dungeon)
          - the whole chart in the pdf are what parameters we need for fwrite and fread (that honestly makes a lot more sense)
          - examples of files are in piazza
        - close the file

    Load function:
        - read file (home/username/.rlg327/dungeon)
        - fread (follow the chart on pdf)
        - print dungeon

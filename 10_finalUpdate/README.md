- We used Prof. Schaeffer's solution code for 1.09
- New features
  - Health potions randomly generate on the floor and can heal 25%-100% of a players health (H)
     - Potions generate as the symbol ^
     - Potions are automatically taken and drunk when walked over UNLESS the player is at full health
  - Use the --hp command to input a custom hp level for the PC (H)
  
  
  (Ideas if you guys are stuck)
